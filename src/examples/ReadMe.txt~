Step-1: Generate the sequence of temporally accumulated stroke pngs using the code in processData.cpp or main.cpp(main.cpp just for one sketch)
Step-2: Thicken each stroke png using the code in ThickenSketches.m. This file can do the augmentation.
Step-3: The thickened sketches can now be used for training or evaluation
